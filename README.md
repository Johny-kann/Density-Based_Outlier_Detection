# Density-Based_Outlier_Detection
Density-Based Outlier Detection using Relative Density and K-means Clustering

Anomaly detection techniques can use Density Based Outlier Detection to detect anomaly data points 

The module 
- can do anomaly detection based on Relative Density outlier score algorithm based on nearest neighbors density
- can do anomaly detection based on clustering which assigns outlier score based on both relative density and the absolute distance from the centroid
- constructs an Area Under Curve to test the results by varying K.

Programming Language
+ Java with Model View Controller Design Pattern

Module was developed only using standard Java libraries under JDK 8 and not by the use of any predefined data mining libraries
